# Generic Hashmap in C

This project implements a generic hashmap in C, similar to the one available in Java. The hashmap supports insertion, searching, and deletion of key-value pairs with generic data types using void pointers.

## Files

- `hashmap.h`: Header file containing the declarations of the hashmap functions and structures.
- `hashmap.c`: Source file containing the implementation of the hashmap functions.
- `main.c`: Example usage of the hashmap.

## Features

- Generic key-value pairs.
- Simple hash function (string keys by default).
- Collision handling using chaining.
- Functions to insert, search, and delete key-value pairs.
- Customizable hash function and key comparison function.
